# Currently this repo only contains a working simulation of a **one** spin system. 2 spins is currently being developed (as of 6/30/23).

<The goal of this project is to simulate a system with two spins under an applied field. We are interested in plotting a hysteresis loop. The mechanics of this system can be better understood through the reading provided in the respective subsection. A simple GUI is implemented to allow users to vary parameters of the simulation.>
